@Dereje and @Elizabeth.
I expect claases for SystemExceptionHandler and CustomExceptionHandler. Please review you code. 
@Elizabeth, check how Dereje added those sections to your code.  
 --SystemExceptionHandler will catch all types of exceptions and writes them in system.log file
--CustomExceptionHandler will handle only those exception related to your chat application message formats and menu’s.

  Add Comments in your codes. in each classes add something like these :

What is Javadoc?

Javadoc is a tool which comes with JDK and it is used for generating Java code documentation in HTML format from Java source code, which requires documentation in a predefined format.

Following is a simple example where the lines inside /*….*/ are Java multi-line comments. Similarly, the line which preceeds // is Java single-line comment.

/**
* The HelloWorld program implements an application that
* simply displays "Hello World!" to the standard output.
*
* @author  Addisu Thomas
* @version 1.0
* @since   2023-01-01 
*/
public class HelloWorld {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Prints Hello, World! on standard output.
      System.out.println("Hello World!");
   }
}
